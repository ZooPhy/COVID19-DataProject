## Information about Tokens

In order to use this code, BTS (Bureau of Transportation Statistics) and CDC (Center for Disease Control) requires an app token in order to make API calls to their data sets. Information on how to acquire the tokens for the travel and vaccine datasets can be found at the following websites. Replace line 31 in /vaccine/vaccine.py and line 23 with /travel/travel.py with the respective account information and app token. Note: will be adding a feature to use app tokens from the command line.
